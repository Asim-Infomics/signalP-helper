# signalP-helper
SignalP-Helper is a lightweight, user-friendly tool designed for biologists who need to extract signal peptides, mature proteins, and non-signal proteins from large proteome FASTA files using SignalP 6.x prediction results. Instead of manually cross-referencing SignalP output files with your FASTA sequences (a time-consuming and error-prone step).
